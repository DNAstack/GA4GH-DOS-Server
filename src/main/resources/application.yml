# This profile is only to remove the PostgreSQL dependency from the "contextLoads" test, which gives early feedback that
# Spring autowiring is likely to work at runtime. Additional Spring integration tests are strongly discouraged because
# they have an unfavourable cost/benefit ratio as compared to more stable e2e tests and faster, simpler Mockito tests.
